I spoke to a man from south Cumbria who had chained himself to fencing outside Carlisle City Council's headquarters in protest.

He made major criticisms of the council, saying he had been left homeless when the authority neglected to repair and reopen one of the city's main homeless hostels following the 2015 winter floods.

The council told me that it was close to reopening John Street Hostel and, at the time of the report, its website said the building would reopen in September 2017.

*In February 2018, John Street Hostel reopened.*
