Part megasale, part social gathering, part competition and part excuse to end some scran[^1], the Borderway Agri-Expo has become one of the UK's biggest agricultural events and it's held every year on the edge of Carlisle. 

I went along for BBC Radio Cumbria to meet some of the people taking part.
