After interviewing the Cumbrian founder of a charity which is helping improve lives in the Ghanian village of Ankoma, I filmed this video on mobile phone and edited it using Final Cut Pro. 

It's got some great shots from Ghana, courtesy of the charity [Ankoma Outreach](http://ankomaoutreach.co.uk/).
