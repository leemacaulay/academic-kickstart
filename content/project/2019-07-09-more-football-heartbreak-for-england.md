One of the best things about getting to work on [BBC Minute](www.bbc.com/minute) is that we get to show a bit of emotion. Newsreaders aren't robots, they're real living people with opinions on things. 

It's obviously a fine line to tread, but you can get away with a bit more on BBC Minute. 

Like this, when I couldn't [actually bring myself to say](https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/every-defeat-a-divorce-three-lions) that England's footballers had been [knocked out in an international semi-final yet again](https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/miserabilia).
