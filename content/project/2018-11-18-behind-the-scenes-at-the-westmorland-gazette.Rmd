The Westmorland Gazette is a newspaper for South Cumbria and the Yorkshire Dales which celebrated its 200th anniversary in May 2018. 

All sorts of famous writers and journalists have been involved in its history, including William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter. 

I was able to take part in a week-long series of reports marking the milestone for BBC Radio Cumbria. 

First up, I went into the archives with Kendal historian Peter Holmes, where I even ended up finding myself among the pages:

Later in the week, I was allowed rare access to the newsroom where journalists and sub-editors were making the finishing touches to that week's newspaper:

`r blogdown::shortcode('audio', '1C8AFDCF_GAZETTE DEADLINE PKG.mp3', 'Deadline day in the newsroom')`

There's more about the [history of the Westmorland Gazette](https://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/aboutus/history/) on its website and staff at the newspaper put together a great magazine looking back over the years which you should be able to track down in Kendal.
