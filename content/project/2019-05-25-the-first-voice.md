I've been part of something exciting that the BBC is trying out for the first time - a bespoke news service for smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple Homepod.

I even ended up being the first person to speak on the first bulletin to go out - which was in no way planned.

It's still going to be put together in the same rigorous way that a news bulletin would be for one of the BBC's domestic radio stations and we're even based in the same radio newsroom in London. 

It will sound a little different. 

Hopefully it will be more conversational and less journalist-y - though there'll always be a balance to reach. 

To listen: 

- **Alexa** :speech_balloon: get BBC News
- **Google Assistant** :speech_balloon: play BBC News
- **Siri** :speech_balloon: listen to BBC News
- **BBC Sounds** search for [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p05hh4qy)

We're still working on it and there's an email address for feedback: good, bad or indifferent. 

It's [bbcvoice.feedback@bbc.co.uk](mailto:bbcvoice.feedback@bbc.co.uk).
