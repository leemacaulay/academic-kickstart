description: 'A diesel locomotive makes one last journey for passengers in Cumbria.'
---

I spent some time at Carlisle railway station as the last Class 37 locomotive left to carry passengers on a farewell journey on the Cumbrian Coast Line to Carnforth. 

The line had become popular with rain enthusiasts as it one of the few places to see diesel locomotives used for regular passenger services. 

The older trains have now been replaced by newer units.
