I was in charge of BBC Cumbria Live on the day that the Settle to Carlisle line fully reopened to passenger trains for the first time in 13 months.

A landslip at Eden Brows near Armathwaite had moved 500,000 tonnes of earth underneath the track.

The live page covered [all the day's activities celebrating the reopening including a visit from the Flying Scotsman](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-cumbria-39372553).
