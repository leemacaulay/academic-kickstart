I'm one of the voices you hear on [BBC News' smart speaker bulletins](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-50068132) including our flash/news briefing, our UK-first interactive audio bulletin and the podcast Coronavirus Update 24/7.

I'm really interested in how radio news bulletins are changing to become a bit more internet, so if you're doing something like that please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/lmcly) so we can chat about it!

I'm on loan from [BBC Radio Cumbria](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiocumbria) where I was a newsreader, producer and reporter.
